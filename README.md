# Shiny-Application-example
This Shiny application is to visualiza and predict the US personal medical insurance cost with the given dataset. 
So far there is a problem about the plot remaining unfixed. When I use ggplot with the same dataset, the plot is shown as usual, but there is problem with x-axis in shiny app.
## Data Source
The data used in this Shiny app is from Kaggle.com, with the link https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance
## How to Run the app
1.You may downloaded the app with the dataset locally and simply open the app.R file in RStudio and click the Run App button.
2.The app can also be run with the following command:

Any correction and suggestion are welcomed.
